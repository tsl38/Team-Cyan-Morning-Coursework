  dialogue:
  - Tony was walking back home to the village of Hilkingham. He suddenly felt extremely
    dizzy and drowsy, and suddenly fell on the floor... After a few hours, Tony finally
    woke up. He could not recall anything about the village he was in. Whilst trying
    to figure out what happened, he noticed there was a letter on the floor. He picked
    it up and read it...
  - "\u201CTo Tony, son of Edward. The memories of the villagers of Hilkingham, including
    yours, have been stolen by the dream eater witch. To retrieve them, you must
    head to the castle. It will not be an easy trip, however. I hope you can make
    it out in one piece. Good luck, \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t--Tawnia\u201D.\r\n"
  - 'The name Tawnia was not familiar to him. He flipped the paper back and found
    a map of the village of Hilkingham, and the castle of Shingville.

    And thus,
    his unlikely adventure began...'
