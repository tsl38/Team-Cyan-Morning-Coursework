  - "Tony walked through thorns and thistles in the dark forest. He put some armour
    on himself for protection. He followed the map that led him to the gate of the
    castle of Shingville. The castle looks haunted and creepy. It is so rusty that
    it seems like no one has been getting in and out of the castle for quite a while.\r\n\r\nThere
    is a mysterious old man with a stick standing in the gate. Tony decided to ask
    him for some news\r."
