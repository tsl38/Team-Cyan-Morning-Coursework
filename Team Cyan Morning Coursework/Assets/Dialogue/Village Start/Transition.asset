  dialogue:
  - Tony walked through thorns and thistles in the dark forest. He equipped himself
    with steel armour for protection. He followed the map that led him to the gate
    of the castle of Shingville. The castle looks haunted and creepy. It is so rusty
    that it seems like no one has been getting in and out of the castle for quite
    a while.
  - There is a mysterious cloaked man with a stick standing at the gate. Tony decided
    to ask him for some information regarding the castle.
