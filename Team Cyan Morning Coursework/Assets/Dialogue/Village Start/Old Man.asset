  - 'Old Man: Warrior, do you want to enter the castle?'
  - 'Tony: Yes, I want to retrieve our memories for the whole village. I received
    a letter that guided me to the dungeon. Do you know some clues about the castle?'
  - 'Old Man: In the early years, there was a myth that there was a witch inside
    this castle. No one dared to go inside. It seems that no one has lived in this
    castle for a long time. I just passed by and'
  - wanted to have a look. It really looks haunted and scary indeed. Anyway, it sounds
    like something very unfortunate happened to you. Are you sure you want to go
    in?
  - 'Tony: I have to go in, I only have this clue right now.'
  - 'Old Man: Sometimes losing memory is not a bad thing. Resetting everything to
    zero can also represent a new chance and hope. But if you insist on doing this,
    I can only wish you good'
  - " luck, young man!\r"
  - 'Tony: Thanks, take care.'
