  dialogue:
  - 'Old Man: Warrior, do you wish to venture into the castle?'
  - 'Tony: Yes, I want to retrieve the villager''s memories about me. I received
    a letter that pointed me towards the castle. Do you happen to know anything about
    it?'
  - 'Old Man: In my early years, there was a myth that there was a witch inside that
    castle. No one dared to go inside. It seems that no one has lived in this castle
    for a long time.'
  - 'Old Man: I just passed by and wanted to have a look. It really looks haunted
    and scary indeed. Anyway, it sounds like something very unfortunate happened
    to you.'
  - 'Old Man: Are you sure you want to venture in there?'
  - 'Tony: I have to, It''s my only way forward.'
  - "Old Man: Sometimes losing memory is not a bad thing. Starting from zero can
    also represent a new chance and hope. But if you insist on doing this, I can
    only wish you good luck, young man!\r"
  - 'Tony: Thank you, take care old man.'
